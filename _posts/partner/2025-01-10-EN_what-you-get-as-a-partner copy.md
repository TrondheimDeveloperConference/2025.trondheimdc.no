## Become a Partner at TDC 2025

TDC is the best technology conference in Trondheim, driven by passionate enthusiasts in the tech community.  
The conference is organized by volunteers with diverse technological backgrounds from the Trondheim region, with support from the Norwegian Computer Society (DND). Our goal is to create a non-commercial conference and meeting place run on a voluntary basis, where technology enthusiasts can learn from each other, share knowledge, and build relationships.

In 2024, we gathered over 900 participants and 25 partners for a sold-out conference â€“ and in 2025 the conference could be even bigger!

### What is it like to be a partner at TDC 2025?

Over the years, TDC has become the most important IT arena in the Trondheim region, a place where technology and community meet. Want to know more about what to expect? Check out our 245+ videos on Vimeo https://vimeo.com/trondheimdc and YouTube https://www.youtube.com/@trondheimdc, our photo bank on Flickr https://www.flickr.com/photos/trondheimdc/, and not least last yearâ€™s vibe video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4sh4y8NhQI.

As a partner, you donâ€™t just get a space in the exhibition area â€“ you become part of an engaged and knowledgeable network. Here you meet the most dedicated developers, skilled designers, technology leaders, and innovators who are driving the industry forward.

We can boast all we want, but TDC wouldnâ€™t be what it is without you â€“ the partners, the speakers, the participants, and not least all of Trondheimâ€™s user groups represented at their own Community stand. It is you who makes this an extraordinary experience, and thatâ€™s why we invite you to join us. Become a partner and help make TDC 2025 the best edition ever!
