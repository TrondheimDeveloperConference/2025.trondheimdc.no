# Code of Conduct

All participants, presenters, partners, staff, and volunteers at the conference are required to follow the guidelines for good conduct. TDC strives to be a pleasant and inclusive conference for all participants, without exception. We do not tolerate physical or electronic harassment of our participants or staff in any form. Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), intentional threats, stalking, photography or audio/video recording without reasonable consent. This includes persistent disruption of conversations or other events, unwanted physical contact, and unwanted sexual attention. Sexual images in public spaces are inappropriate for TDC, especially in lectures and workshops, but also at social events, X, and other online media.

Partners are also subject to this policy. Partners should not use sexualized images, sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Participants, presenters, or partners who are asked to stop harassing or inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers will follow up with the offended party and take all actions they find appropriate, from warning the offender to expulsion from the conference without refund.

Do you see or experience violations of these guidelines? Speak up. We cannot be everywhere all the time. If you are being harassed, or notice someone else being harassed, speak up if you feel it is safe, and contact one of us from the Program Committee immediately. Even if the situation has already been handled, this will help us monitor for further issues.

Unsure who to contact? All organizers are wearing a t-shirt with CREW on the back.
