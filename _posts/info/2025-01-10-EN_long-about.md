# Welcome to TDC 2025

TDC 2025 is the 11th conference since 2012 organized by the TDC community. Don't miss our anniversary conference with inspiring lectures, plenty of time for mingling, and an after-party to wrap up the evening!

TDC is carried out by a cross-section of various technology communities in the Trondheim region with help from the Norwegian Computer Society (DND). Our goal is to organize a non-commercial, community-driven conference with technology enthusiasts where we can learn from each other, share knowledge, and meet.

Since the beginning in 2012, we've seen "our little conference" grow to more than 700 participants in recent years before the pandemic. In 2024, we had more than 800 people through the doors and are aiming for the same this year. The conference is running this year with up to six tracks and more than 35 lectures distributed across the various tracks.

Now that the pandemic is finally in a well-diminished stage, we look forward to meeting to learn, laugh, and share.

TDC will never be TDC without all of you. Join us on October 20th and take the Technology Capital forward into the future!
