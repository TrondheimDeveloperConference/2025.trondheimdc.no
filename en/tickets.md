We’re almost ready to open up ticket sales!

If you’re thinking of joining us (and you totally should), it pays to be early—TDC usually sells out well before the conference kicks off.

<div class="my-4">
	<a class="btn btn-lg btn-buy d-inline-flex align-items-center gap-2 px-4 py-3" href="https://event.checkin.no/123436/tdc-2025" role="button" target="_blank">
		<span class="fw-bold">Buy tickets</span>
		<i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i>
	</a>
	<!-- Styled like the NDC site but points to our own ticket path. -->
</div>

Can’t make it after all?

Life happens, we get it. If something comes up and you can’t attend, we’ve got your back:

- We offer full refunds on tickets up to two weeks before the conference.
- After that, we sadly can’t refund your ticket—but you’re totally welcome to pass it on or resell it to a lucky fellow dev.

Need a refund or want to change the name on your ticket?

Just drop us a line at [connect@trondheimdc.no](mailto:connect@trondheimdc.no).
