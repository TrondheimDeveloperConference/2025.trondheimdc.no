All participants, speakers, partners, staff, and volunteers at the conference are required to follow the Code of Conduct. TDC strives to be a welcoming and inclusive conference for all attendees, without exception. We do not tolerate physical or digital harassment of our participants or staff in any form.

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), deliberate intimidation, stalking, photography or audio/video recording without appropriate consent. It also includes sustained disruption of talks or other events, unwelcome physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual imagery in public spaces is inappropriate at TDC—this applies to talks and workshops, as well as social events, X (formerly Twitter), and other online platforms.

Partners are also subject to this policy. They must not use sexualised images, clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

Participants, speakers, or partners who are asked to stop any harassing or inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers will take appropriate action, which may include issuing a warning or expelling the offender from the conference without refund.

#### Witness or Experience a Breach of These Guidelines?
Please speak up. We can’t be everywhere at once. If you are being harassed, or notice someone else being harassed, say something if you feel safe to do so, and contact one of the organisers immediately. Even if the situation has already been addressed, reporting it helps us monitor for further issues.

Not sure who to contact? All organisers will be wearing t-shirts with CREW printed on the back.

#### Our values

We value your attendance and want to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all participants. Our code of conduct is designed to protect you and enhance your conference experience.
