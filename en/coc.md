Let’s keep this simple: be cool. That means everyone—attendees, speakers, partners, crew, and volunteers—needs to follow the Code of Conduct. It applies everywhere the conference happens, whether that’s in-person or online: talks, stands, workshops, Slack threads, social hangouts, or random hallway conversations.
At TDC, we’re all about good vibes and making sure everyone feels safe, welcome, and included. No exceptions.

That means we have zero tolerance for harassment of any kind—physical, verbal, digital, emotional, existential... you get the idea.
Harassment includes (but is not limited to):

- Offensive comments about gender, age, sexual orientation, disabilities, appearance, body size, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof)
- Threats, stalking, or creeping people out in general
- Taking photos, video, or audio of someone without their OK
- Interrupting talks or conversations repeatedly (you know who you are)
- Unwanted touching or flirting
- Basically, anything that makes someone feel uncomfortable or unsafe

Also: sexy images, videos, slides, or jokes? Not the place. This includes talks, workshops, social events, social media, and more. Partners, we’re looking at you too—no sexy costumes or marketing gimmicks. We’re here to code, not to cringe.

If someone asks you to stop any behavior that’s crossing the line? Stop. Immediately.
We’re not here to police anyone, but we will take action if we need to—from a friendly warning to asking you to leave the conference. And no, there won’t be a refund if that happens.

See something shady? Or feel like something’s off? Tell us. We can’t be everywhere all the time, so we rely on you to speak up if it feels safe. Whether it’s happening to you or someone else, please flag it to someone on the Program Committee ASAP. Even if the issue seems “handled,” we still want to know—it helps us watch out for more trouble.

Not sure who to talk to?
Look for someone in a T-shirt with CREW on the back and a big “Ask me” button. We’re here for you.
