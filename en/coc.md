All attendees, speakers, partners, staff, and volunteers are required to follow our Code of Conduct. TDC aims to be a friendly and inclusive conference for everyone. We do not tolerate physical or online harassment of our participants or staff in any form. Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), deliberate intimidation, stalking, photography or audio/video recording without reasonable consent. This includes sustained disruption of talks or other events, unwanted physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexualized images in public spaces are inappropriate for TDC—especially in talks and workshops, but also at social events, on X, and in other online media.

Partners are also subject to this policy. Partners must not use sexualized images, sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Participants, speakers, or partners who are asked to stop any harassing or inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers will follow up with the affected party and take any action they deem appropriate, from a warning to expulsion from the conference without refund.

Do you see or experience a breach of these guidelines? Please speak up. We can’t be everywhere all the time. If you are harassed, or notice that someone else is being harassed, say something if you feel safe to do so, and contact one of us from the Program Committee immediately. Even if the situation has already been handled, this helps us keep an eye out for further issues.

Not sure who to contact? All organizers wear t-shirts with CREW on the back.
