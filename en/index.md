TDC is a non-commercial conference, where any surplus is used to drive next year's conference and support community events in Trondheim. For example, we fund venues for meetups, and the conference charter explicitly states that the conference will help grow the IT community in the Trondheim region through talks, meetups and networking.

This year's conference is organized by several groups, with the Norwegian Computer Society as our main partner.
