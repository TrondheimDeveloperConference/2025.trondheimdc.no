#### How Do I Get There?
The hotel address is Brattørkaia 1, 7010 Trondheim. Whether you're travelling from afar or within Trondheim, we recommend choosing environmentally friendly transport options.

##### Bus and Train
Within Trondheim, you can travel by bus using a single ticket purchased via the AtB app. Bus numbers 21, 23, and 28 stop at the nearest bus stop by Pirbadet.
If you're arriving by train, it's about a 5-minute walk from the train station to the conference venue.

##### Air Travel
If you're travelling from further afield and arriving at Trondheim Airport Værnes, you can take the train from the airport to Trondheim Central Station (Trondheim S), then walk to the conference. The local train departs regularly from Værnes (approximately once an hour during the day). Visit <a href="https://www.sj.no" target="_blank">https://www.sj.no</a> for more information.
Alternatively, you can take the airport express bus – Værnesekspressen. The bus departs in connection with each arriving flight (roughly every 15 minutes during the day) and stops at Olav Tryggvasons gate, which is about a 10-minute walk from the hotel. See <a href="https://www.vaernesekspressen.no" target="_blank">https://www.vaernesekspressen.no</a> for timetables.

#### Good to Know During the Conference
During the conference, you can leave your coat in the cloakroom located to the left of the main entrance. We recommend keeping your valuables with you throughout the event.
