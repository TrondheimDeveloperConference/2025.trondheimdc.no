TDC will be held at Clarion Hotel & Congress Trondheim on 20 October 2025. Below you’ll find information you may need.

#### How do I get there?
The hotel address is Brattørkaia 1, 7010 Trondheim.
For traveling to and from TDC—both within Trondheim and from out of town—we recommend environmentally friendly transport.

##### Bus and train
Within Trondheim you can travel by bus using the AtB app to buy single tickets. You can take bus no. 21, 23 and 28 to the nearest stop by Pirbadet.

If you arrive by train, it’s about a 5-minute walk from Trondheim Central Station to the conference venue.

##### Flight
If you fly into Trondheim Airport Værnes, you can take the train from the airport to Trondheim Central Station and walk from there to the venue. The local train runs frequently from Værnes (about once per hour during the day). See [www.sj.no](https://www.sj.no) for more information.

You can also take the airport bus – Værnesekspressen. The bus departs in connection with each arriving flight (about every 15 minutes during the day) and stops at Olav Tryggvasons gate – about a 10-minute walk from the hotel. See [https://www.vaernesekspressen.no/](https://www.vaernesekspressen.no/) for timetables.

#### Good to know during the conference
During the conference you can leave your jacket in the cloakroom to the left of the main entrance. We recommend keeping valuables with you during the day.
