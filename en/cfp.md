Our CFP for 2025 is officially closed—and wow, you all really delivered!

We’ve received a ton of awesome submissions and have put together a program packed with talks on digital design, frontend, backend, agile development, and a bunch of other juicy topics.

We’re aiming for a sweet mix of local legends, national experts, and international stars—and thanks to your incredible response, that’s exactly what we’re getting.

Huge thanks to everyone who submitted a proposal. You made our job delightfully difficult.
