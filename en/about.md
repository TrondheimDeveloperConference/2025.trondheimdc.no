### A conference by and for the Trondheim region
TDC is organized by a cross-section of technology groups in the Trondheim region with support from the Norwegian Computer Society (DND). Our goal is to run a non-commercial, volunteer-driven conference for technology enthusiasts where we can learn from each other, share knowledge, and connect.

Any surplus is used to power next year’s conference and to support local tech community events in Trondheim. For example, we fund venues for meetups. The conference charter explicitly states that TDC will help grow the regional tech community through talks, meetups, and networking.

#### TDC in short
TDC was first held in 2012. From 2012 to 2019 it grew into a well-known gathering for people interested in technology in the Trondheim region, and speakers like Scott Hanselman, Brian Christian, and Linda Liukas have all graced the stage. During the pandemic years, the conference ran in a smaller format as TDC Community Week. Post-pandemic, we invested in reviving the conference, and in 2024 TDC was held for the tenth time. The conference continues to grow, now featuring dozens of talks, 20–30 exhibitors, and up to 1,000 attendees.

The conference “TDC” started as “Trondheim Developer Conference”, but that name was felt to be too narrow. The conference is for everyone working in technology—designers, product managers, backend developers, and more. Today, TDC is simply “TDC”, and the letter “D” can stand for whatever you want!
